# :trophy: Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

## :thinking: Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:

- I love a good puzzle and this is quicker than a crossword
- Daily practice = Repetition of core concepts
- Love ~~to smash the~~ **friendly** competition
- What better way to deepen my understanding of the language than to use it?

## :notebook: Some Notes

At the moment all the challenges here are [Codewars](https://codewars.com) katas. I keep note of their names, but not the instructions. If you want to work on a the same kata as I have, please feel free to visit my [profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/CrazyCarlo/completed_solutions) and view my completed list.

I **love** friendly competition, so if you want to crush me on the leaderboard, feel free to follow me on there and let me know so I can follow you back.

These challenges are a study tool for me, so you'll likely see a lot of repetition of the same challenge. I do this so that I can practice with different methods, or sometimes just for kicks.
